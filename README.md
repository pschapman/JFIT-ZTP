# JotForm Form Import Tool for freeZTP (JFIT-ZTP)
## Introduction
This program was created to be an add-on to freeZTP, a program which automates deployment of Cisco switches and routers.  Specifically, JFIT-ZTP was designed for Just-In-Time systems deployemnt where JotForm is used by field teams to provide mappings between device serial numbers and hostnames.

In large scale deployments it may be impractical to pre-map data needed for ZTP to properly deploy devices.  Contributing factors may include:

1. Staging is too costly / time consuming.
2. Stack arrangements need to be flexible so that field teams can make last minute changes.
3. Logistics required for tracking pre-configured devices is extremely difficult.
